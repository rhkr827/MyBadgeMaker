# MyBadgeMaker
`Related skill badges created by shields.io`

### Purpose
```text
  - Due to too long url which custom created shields.io badge using base64 image, 
    not support logo in https://simpleicons.org(maybe due to license)
  - For using shorten url via this repository url if need to insert skills badge
```

### 1. Download Badge(Done)
```text
  - Downloaded badges from badge list in text file(markdown syntax insert img via url)
  - Downloaded bades in ./Badges in this repository
```
### 2. Create Bades
```text
  - Tried to make skill badge used by badge-maker, even though spent not much time ,but failed
  - Will be update this function(maybe not do this)
```
### 3. Convert image
```text
  - Tried to convert image such as png, jpeg to svg file throught online converter
  - But not good quality due to limited size support in shields.io(under 8192 bytes)
  - Due to above reason failed few skills of badge
  - Will be update this fuction(maybe not do this)
```
